## Hisabo
     
I founded and ran [Hisabo Tea Company](http://www.hisabo.com) for a few months as a side project.

Through Hisabo, we sold hard to find or unique teas to a list of email subscribers (similar to Garagiste for wines). 

We sourced each tea through a network of connections in Japan, Taiwan, China and Nepal.

I stopped working on Hisabo to focus exclusively on Shortlist.
