## Writing

I write often, though not nearly as much as I should. In my spare time, you'll find me answering questions on tech news / trends, imagining the future, exploring social issues, and, of course, chronicling design ideas I like and dislike. Check out the sections below to see some of my more 'popular writing.'

## [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ryan-Borker)

I write on Quora from time to time. In part because it pays better than a lot of other writing. Some of the popular things I've written are about running and tech strategy. Highlights include:

### [Should I complete a marathon without training?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-complete-a-marathon-without-training-for-it) 
Hint: no.

### [Why did Uber beat Lyft?](https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Uber-so-successful-vs-Lyft-Sidecar-etc)
This one got published in Newsweek.

### [How will marketing change in the next 10 years](https://www.quora.com/How-is-marketing-going-to-evolve-over-the-next-ten-years-as-a-result-of-technological-innovation) 
Speculating on the future of marketing.

### [Is the Lobster and indictment of our Tinder-driven dating culture?](https://www.quora.com/Is-The-Lobster-an-indictment-of-our-Tinder-driven-dating-culture) 
I do pop culture too.

### [How can we improve hiring diversity?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-specific-things-employers-can-do-today-to-build-more-diverse-technical-teams) 
I've spent a lot of time thinking about this at Shortlist.



## [Medium](https:/www.medium.com/@borker)

On Medium, I take a more speculative or reflective approach. Don't expect miracles.


### [You're better off dead than on Facebook](https://medium.com/@borker/youre-better-off-dead-than-on-facebook-linkedin-or-twitter-d466806544d5) 
I spend a lot of time thinking about how we spend our attention, and whether it's intentional or not. Social media takes a huge share of our most precious resource.

### [How to prepare for your first investor meeting](https://medium.com/listen-to-my-story/checklist-how-to-prep-for-your-first-investor-meeting-c119c0fc74eb)
Featured in Mattermark Daily.

### [Is the weak tie dead?](https://medium.com/@JoinShortlist/strong-ties-are-more-important-than-ever-bb2136d4dd1f) 
I think weak ties are overemphasized. We need to begin to reform strong ties.

### [Can anyone stop LinkedIn?](https://medium.com/@JoinShortlist/can-anyone-stop-linkedin-hints-from-the-users-911cd653ec23) 
Written from Shortlist's perspective, before the acquisition. I still believe this.
