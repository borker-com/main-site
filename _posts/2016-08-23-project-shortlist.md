## Shortlist
     
I cofounded [Shortlist](https://www.joinshortlist.com) where I was the COO and Head of Product. 

Top finance companies have (including 8 of the top 30 asset managers) used Shortlist to recruit outstanding individuals to their most senior roles. These roles would otherwise have gone to retained search. 

The Shortlist platform achieved a number of industry firsts for a recruiting tech platform in asset management: 
- First to receive exclusivity on postings
- First to recruit at the senior level (C-suite, SVP, etc.)
- First vertical 'curated' network for senior level recruiting
